There is already a Retrieved Dataframe, we shall add new results to this existing dataframe, excluding duplicates.
We are not updating the previous search(es) of the DataFrame, only looking for new lines
This look like a search string or list of pmids. 
If this is not correct Please stop now
There are no new lines since your previous search - stop the function.
